"""
 After a Fascist policy is enacted, need to check if a new power is available, that depends on the amount of players
 that were there at the start of the game (could be more than active players if any get assassinated)
 POWER GRANTED MAPPING FORMAT
 (number of enacted fascist polices) + (condition) -> (return value)
 1 + 9-10 players -> 1
 2 + 7-10 players -> 1
 3 + 7-10 players -> 2
 3 + 5-6 players -> 3
 4 -> 4
 5 -> 4 and 5
 6 will be checked prior to calling this function
 0 is not a possible case as this function is only called AFTER a Fascist policy is enacted
 
 POWER TRANSLATOR
 (return value) -> (description of power)
 1 -> President must view identity card (liberal or fascist, can't tell if Hitler) of a player that has not already
 been viewed before
 2 -> President must to pick the next Presidential candidate. This does not restart the order of presidents thereafter
 3 -> President must view top 3 cards of the deck before the next election cycle
 4 -> President must assassinate a player that is not themselves
 5 -> The only power that cannot be used before next election is this. Now after any future president views three cards
 and discards one, while the chancellor has the two remaining cards they may ask the President about Veto-ing this set.
 If both the President and Chancellor agree to Veto, then both cards the Chancellor holds get discarded and the next 
 election cycle begins
